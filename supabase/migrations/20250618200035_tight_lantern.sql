-- Update the site URL in auth configuration
-- This needs to be done through the Supabase dashboard, but we can document it here

-- Note: The following settings need to be updated in your Supabase Dashboard:
-- 1. Go to Authentication > Settings
-- 2. Update "Site URL" to: https://kyleseanpm.com
-- 3. Add "https://kyleseanpm.com/**" to "Redirect URLs"
-- 4. Remove any localhost URLs from redirect URLs if they exist

-- For now, we'll create a placeholder migration that documents these required changes
